## Check Anagram or Not
Given a string S and a non-empty string P, find string S is Anagram of P.
Check if the string S can be equal to P when charectors in P are rearranged

Strings consists of lowercase English letters only and the length of both strings S and P will not be larger than 20,100.


# Example 1:

## Input:
Enter first string S: creative
Enter first string P: reactive
## Output:
Strings are Anagram

Explanation:
Length of String S is equal to Length of String P  
 "creative" is rearranged and found "reactive" 

# Example 2:

## Input:
Enter first string S: angel
Enter first string P: glean
## Output:
Strings are Anagram

Explanation:

 # Example 3:

## Input:
Enter first string S: car
Enter first string P: cat
## Output:
